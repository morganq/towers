Rules
=====


Setup
-----
* Place all the Room tiles face-down and randomly re-arrange them. 
* Shuffle the Client deck and put it face-down somewhere in the play space. 
* Make a pile of $ coins. 

Round Setup
-----------
* Each player takes 15 Room tiles at random from the communal pile, face-down. 
* Draw 2 cards from the Client deck for each player in the game. Place these cards face-up in the middle of the playing area, in reach of each player.
* Players should be given a moment to inspect the various clients that are available this round. Looking at these cards will guide how the players build their towers.
* Begin the round when all players are ready.


Round Gameplay
--------------
Players begin placing tiles to build up their skyscraper. Tiles must be placed aligned with the grid, so that there's no space between rooms. At the end of the round, a skyscraper may not have rooms hanging over space. The skyscraper must also be a single building, you must connect all free-standing towers at some shared base (although free-standing towers are not likely to win the game). Otherwise, the setup of your skyscraper is completely up to you. You may have a very wide building, or a building that has thin towers, or something boring and regular. 

When you are satisfied with your setup, pick one Client card from the selections in the middle of the play area. *The faster you finish building, the greater selection of Client cards you have available.* It is a skyscraper race, after all!

Once each player has picked a client card, each player has an opportunity to select a second one. The order the players chose the first time is reversed for this second selection. 

Players now take turns (in the first-finished order) cashing in any Client cards they may have. A player can opt to cash in as many as she wishes (including zero.) Cashing in a Client causes its special ability to be activated immediately.

Then, set up the next round and do it again.

Client Cards
------------
A Client Card represents a person or corporation looking to buy space in your tower. A client has a demand (a pattern) and, often, a special ability. The client will pay you to fulfill her demand, and will then fill up that space in your tower. You don't necessarily get the money or the ability immediately, you can cash it in during any round. An example will be useful here.

Let's say you're eyeing the client card DrugCorp, which is in the middle of the table at the start of round 1. DrugCorp looks like this:

	Pattern: [r][r]
	            [r]
	            [r]

	Ability: When any other players cash in a non-DrugCorp retail Client, DrugCorp buys out 2 of those rooms instead. That player may not put $ coins on two rooms (their choice), and you put an extra $ coin on each of two DrugCorp rooms (your choice; doesn't matter) in your tower. 

You have 5 Retail spaces to place, so you take four of them and make one copy of the pattern somewhere within your building. At the end of the round, your building looks like this:

	[r][r]         [o]
	[o][r][e]   [h][h]
	[o][r][e][r][h][h]

You're the first one finished, so you snatch up that DrugCorp card. You don't cash it in yet. In the second round, you draw a few more retail Room tiles. You realize you can make a second copy of that same pattern now with those tiles, which means it will count for double the money! You also see that some other players have picked up non-DrugCorp retail clients and you want to screw them with the special ability before they cash in. 

When your turn to cash in Clients comes around, you put the Client card in front of you and put a $ piece on each room the Client is buying up. In this case, that would mean putting 8 $ pieces, one on each room so that you can mark them as "sold". The pattern counts as many times at it appears, which means it can often be advantageous to keep Clients around for a while before cashing them in. The Client card stays in front of you so that other players remember to deduct the 2 room-purchases from their towers and give those $ to you when applicable. Thanks, DrugCorp!

Endgame
--------
After 5 rounds, the game ends. The player with the most $ wins, *however* there are a few important bonuses which now take effect.

* The player with the tallest tower at the end of the game is granted $10.
* Each player gets $2 for each floor connected to the ground by an elevator.
