Round Gameplay
--------------
Players begin placing their tiles face-up to build up their skyscraper. Tiles must be placed aligned with the grid, so that there's no space between rooms. At the end of the round, a skyscraper may not have rooms hanging over empty space. The architecture of your skyscraper is completely up to you. You may have a very wide building, or a building that has thin towers, or something boring and regular. The only judge of your tower will be your potential clients! 

When all players are satisfied with their towers, it is time to select Clients from the middle. The player with the tallest tower so far has the first choice, and selection resolves from tallest to shortest. When a Client card is selected, that player draws the card into her hand. It is no longer public information.

Once each player has picked a first client card, each player has an opportunity to select a second one. The order is reversed for this second selection. Each player should have drawn 2 cards by the end of this process. 

Players now take turns (in tallest-first order) cashing in any Client cards they may have. A player can opt to cash in as many as she wishes (including zero.) Cashing in a Client causes its special ability to be activated immediately. If a player has more than 3 cards in her hand after cashing in, she must discard down to 3. 

Then, set up the next round and do it again.

Client Cards
------------
A Client Card represents a person or corporation looking to buy space in your tower. A client has a demand (a pattern) and, sometimes, a special ability. The client will pay you to fulfill her demand, and will then fill up that space in your tower. You hold these cards in your hand until you cash them in. An example will be useful here.

Let's say you're eyeing the client card DrugCorp, which is in the middle of the table at the start of round 1. DrugCorp looks like this:

	Pattern: [r][r]
	            [r][r]

	Ability: When any other players cash in a non-DrugCorp retail Client this turn, DrugCorp buys out
	2 of those rooms instead. That player may not put $ coins on two rooms for that
	Client and you gain $2. 

You have 5 Retail spaces to place, so you take four of them and make one copy of the pattern somewhere within your building. At the end of the round, your building looks like this:

	   [r][p]
	[r][r][o][s]   
	[o][r][r][s]

You manage to get the DrugCorp card during the Client selection phase.

When your turn to cash in Clients comes around, you put the Client card in front of you and put a $ piece on each room the Client is buying up. In this case, that would mean putting 4 $ pieces, one on each room so that you can mark them as "sold". If any other players cash in a retail card this turn, you get to take $2 from them because of DrugCorp's special ability. Heck yes! Your building at the beginning of the next turn will look like this:

	   [r][p]
	[$][$][o][s]   
	[o][$][$][s]

Clients can only be cashed in if there are stairs on every floor leading up to at least one of the rooms of the client's pattern. You can cash in a client with a pattern that stretches from floor 3 to floor 6, as long as there are stairs on at least floors 1, 2, and 3. 

Floors
------
A floor in a building is a horizontal row that has at least two adjacent tiles, and one of them must be stairs. In other words:

Building with 3 floors:

	[s]				< invalid, no rooms
	[o][o]			< invalid, no stairs
	[s][o]			< valid
	[o][r][s]		< valid
	[s][r][r][p]	< valid

The height of a building is determined by the number of floors.

Trading-in
----------
During the placement phase, you may trade in 2 of your tiles for any one tile of your choice. You may do this trade as many times as you like.

Bonuses
-------
Every stair tile that is directly above or below another stair tile magically turns into an elevator. Elevator tiles are worth $2 each at the end of the game. You can only get $2 per floor out of this. 

Endgame
--------
After 8 rounds, the game ends. Total each player's money; the winner is the person with the most!
